Search Portal Single Page Application
=====================================

A frontend build in Vue that provides a search bar, filters and viewing results.
As well as a way for users to organise themselves in communities.


Installation
------------

Installation of the frontend is a lot more straightforward than the other components.
From the ``portal`` directory run:

```bash
npm ci
```


Getting started
---------------

You can run the frontend in tandem with the ``service`` backend on the host.
This is useful for running (Python) debuggers or Selenium tests.
To work on the frontend in this mode you only need to start a watcher that builds the frontend after each change.

```bash
npm run watch
```

Notice that if you run ``service`` inside containers the frontend build will only update after a container build.
For local frontend development with containers it's more convenient to use the Vue development server.
This server then acts as a proxy/loadbalancer before the ``service`` backend,
but the frontend comes entirely from Vue development server.

```bash
npm run serve
```


#### Available apps

If you run the frontend through the ``service``. Then the frontend is available under:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/
```

If you use the Vue development server it is available under:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/
```


#### Logging in locally

On the servers the login works through SURFConext.
It's a bit of a hassle to make that work locally.
So we've opted for a way to work around SURFConext when logging in during development.

Simply login to the Django admin of the ``service``.
Once logged in clicking the frontend login button.
This will fetch an API token in development mode and "log you in".
From there on out there is no difference between the remote and local login.
